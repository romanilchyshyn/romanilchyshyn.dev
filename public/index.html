<h2 id="hi-there">Hi there!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my little corner of the Internet.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing software engineering for the past decade. I started
out as a mobile iOS developer working with Objective-C and Swift. These
days, I mostly focus on building microservices in Go.</p>
<p>I’m still learning and enjoy diving deeper into hardware
architecture, operating systems, machine learning, and interesting
programming languages.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been into flying and building FPV UAVs - from 1.6”
tiny-whoops to 10” rigs built for very specific purposes.</p>
