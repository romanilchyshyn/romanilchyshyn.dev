# Roman Ilchyshyn

## Hi there!

Welcome to my little corner of the Internet.

I've been doing software engineering for the past decade. I started out as a 
mobile iOS developer working with Objective-C and Swift. These days, I mostly 
focus on building microservices in Go.

I'm still learning and enjoy diving deeper into hardware architecture, 
operating systems, machine learning, and interesting programming languages.

Lately, I've been into flying and building FPV UAVs - from 1.6" tiny-whoops 
to 10" rigs built for very specific purposes.
